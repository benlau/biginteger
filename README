What the Big Integer Library provides
=====================================
This library contains two classes, BigUnsigned and BigInteger, that represent nonnegative integers and integers, respectively, of size limited only by your computer's memory.  Their capabilities include these operators:
        Math:   +  -  *  /  %  &  |  ^  unary-
  Assignment: = += -= *= /= %= &= |= ^= ++ --
  Comparison:   == != <  <= >  >=
In the works are the << and >> operators, integer algorithms like `gcd', and possibly a working implementation of RSA using the library.

Using the features of the library
=================================
The file `sample.cc' explains and demonstrates the most important features of the library.  I recommend that you read `sample.cc' and then run the sample program it contains.  If you want to do something not shown in `sample.cc' or want more detail, read the actual header and source files, which are extensively commented.

Compiling programs with the library
===================================
The library consists of a folder full of header files (`.hh') and source files (`.cc').  `#include' header files and compile with source files as necessary for your own programs.  For those who use `make', a `Makefile' is included that compiles the source code to object files (`.o') and compiles the sample program.

Bugs
====
The library has been tested by myself and others but is by no means bug-free.  The programs you write using the library will be the best test of its correctness.  I urge you to report any problems that you find, whether they come in the form of compiling trouble, mathematically inaccurate results, or runtime memory-management bloopers (which, since I use Java, are altogether too common in my C++).

Keep in touch
=============
Feel free to e-mail me at `hashproduct@verizon.net' to report bugs or request features.  When I fix the bug or add the feature, you will generally be credited by name in the source code and/or the Change Log unless you request otherwise.  I am also curious as to what uses you find for the library.  If you would like an e-mail whenever a new version of the library is released, e-mail me to join my informal mailing list.  New versions of the library will be available at the project Web site at `http://mysite.verizon.net/mccutchen/bigint/'.
